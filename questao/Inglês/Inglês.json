If our foreign language teaching happens in a critical literacy perspective, then we also learn that such di(cid:41)erent ways to interpret reality are legitimized and valued according to socially and historically constructed criteria that can be collectively reproduced and accepted or questioned and changed.Hence our view of the EFL classroom, at least in Brazil, as an ideal space for the development of citizenship: the EFL classrooms can adopt a critical discursive view of reality that helps students see claims to truth as arbitrary, and power as a transitory force which, although being always present, is also in permanent change, in a movement that constantly allows for radical transformation. The EFL classroom can thus raise students’ perception of their role in the transformation of society, once it might provide them with a space where they are able to challenge their own views, to question where di(cid:41)erent perspectives (including those allegedly present in the texts) come from and where they lead to. By questioning their assumptions and those perceived in the texts, and in doing so also broadening their views, we claim students will be able to see themselves as critical subjects, capable of acting upon the world. […] We believe that there is nothing wrong with using the mother tongue in the foreign language classroom, since strictly speaking, the mother tongue is also foreign - it’s not “mine”, but “my mother’s”: it was therefore foreign as I (cid:58)rst learned it and while I was learning to use its interpretive procedures. When using critical literacy in the teaching of foreign languages we assume that a great part of the discussions proposed in the FL class may happen in the mother tongue. Such discussions will bring meaning to the classroom, moving away from the notion that only simple ideas can be dealt with in the FL lesson because of the students’ lack of pro(cid:58)ciency to produce deeper meanings and thoughts in the FL. Since the stress involved in trying to understand a foreign language is eased, students will be able to bring their “real” world to their English lessons and, by so doing, discussions in the mother tongue will help students learn English as a social practice of meaning-making.

The (cid:58)lm, which took home the prize for Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards, as well as honors for Mahershala Ali as Best Supporting Actor and Nick Vallelonga, Brian Currie and Peter Farrelly for Best Original Screenplay, depicts the burgeoning friendship between a black classical pianist and his Italian- American driver as they travel the 1960s segregated South on a concert tour. But while Green Book was an awards frontrunner all season, its road to Oscar night was riddled with missteps and controversies over its authenticity and racial politics. Green Book is about the relationship between two real-life people: Donald Shirley and Tony “Lip” Vallelonga. Shirley was born in 1927 and grew up in a well-o(cid:41) black family in Florida, where he emerged as a classical piano prodigy: he possessed virtuosic technique and a (cid:58)rm grasp of both classical and pop repertoire. He went on to perform regularly at Carnegie Hall— right below his regal apartment—and work with many prestigious orchestras, like the Chicago Symphony and the New York Philharmonic. But at a time when prominent black classical musicians were few and far between due to racist power structures, he never secured a spot in the upper echelons of the classical world. (African Americans still only make up 1.8 percent of musicians playing in orchestras nationwide, according to a recent study.) Vallelonga was born in 1930 to working-class Italian parents and grew up in the Bronx. As an adult he worked as a bouncer, a maître d’ and a chau(cid:41)eur, and he was hired in 1962 to drive Shirley on a concert tour through the Jim Crow South. The mismatched pair spent one and a half years together on the road — though it’s condensed to just a couple of months in the (cid:58)lm — wriggling out of perilous situations and learning about each other’s worlds. Vallelonga would later become an actor and land a recurring role on The Sopranos. In the 1980s, Vallelonga’s son, Nick, approached his father and Shirley about making a movie about their friendship.

    "enunciado": "What to Know About the Controversy Surrounding the Movie Green Book Depending on who you ask, Green Book is either the pinnacle of movie magic or a whitewashing sham. The (cid:58)lm, which took home the prize for Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards, as well as honors for Mahershala Ali as Best Supporting Actor and Nick Vallelonga, Brian Currie and Peter Farrelly for Best Original Screenplay, depicts the burgeoning friendship between a black classical pianist and his Italian- American driver as they travel the 1960s segregated South on a concert tour. But while Green Book was an awards frontrunner all season, its road to Oscar night was riddled with missteps and controversies over its authenticity and racial politics. Green Book is about the relationship between two real-life people: Donald Shirley and Tony “Lip” Vallelonga. Shirley was born in 1927 and grew up in a well-o(cid:41) black family in Florida, where he emerged as a classical piano prodigy: he possessed virtuosic technique and a (cid:58)rm grasp of both classical and pop repertoire. He went on to perform regularly at Carnegie Hall— right below his regal apartment—and work with many prestigious orchestras, like the Chicago Symphony and the New York Philharmonic. But at a time when prominent black classical musicians were few and far between due to racist power structures, he never secured a spot in the upper echelons of the classical world. (African Americans still only make up 1.8 percent of musicians playing in orchestras nationwide, according to a recent study.) Vallelonga was born in 1930 to working-class Italian parents and grew up in the Bronx. As an adult he worked as a bouncer, a maître d’ and a chau(cid:41)eur, and he was hired in 1962 to drive Shirley on a concert tour through the Jim Crow South. The mismatched pair spent one and a half years together on the road — though it’s condensed to just a couple of months in the (cid:58)lm — wriggling out of perilous situations and learning about each other’s worlds.

    "enunciado": "Internal audit’s role in ESG reporting Conversations and focus on sustainability, typically grouped into environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, are quickly evolving — from activist investor groups and inquisitive regulators pushing for change to governing bodies and C-suite executives struggling to understand and embrace the concept. At the forefront of this new risk area is pressure for organizations to make public commitments to sustainability and provide routine updates to ESG-related strategies, goals, and metrics that are accurate and relevant. However, ESG reporting is still immature, and there is not a lot of de(cid:58)nitive guidance for organizations in this space. For example, there is no single standard for what should be reported.

    "enunciado": "Global Perspectives of Public Administration From a global perspective, public administration still raises passionate debates. Many of us presume to know the virtues of a globalized world, where commerce (cid:89)ourishes without barriers, cultures intertwine with each other, communication and technologies connect distant places to local villages and even to one’s living room. We probably agree that globalization creates a sense of togetherness, a feeling that events on one side of the world concern people living on the other side and that democracy and good governance are globalized aspirations to which people of all nations are prime subscribers. We soon realize however that globalization carries within it an insatiable spirit of competition and greed. The idea that the (cid:58)ttest, the strongest ultimately destroys the weakest, is straight from the jungle. The notion that globalization facilitates the overhauling of established norms and values, for better or for worse, is very much practicable. What are public administrators to do when globalization seems to threaten the very customs and values that glue their society together? […] The notion that public administration is a global phenomenon, subject to universal principles of moralities and values is tantalizing but questionable. A particular form of governance seems to work well for societies with common cores principles and traditional heritage, while another form of practice seems to facilitate better the development and aspirations of citizens in other corners of the world. Public administrators are (cid:58)rst and foremost responsible for the management of their constituent’s a(cid:41)airs. They should dedicate their time and energy to respond to the aspirations and desiderata of their people and within the established boundaries of their societies. Public administrators seem to be more e(cid:41)ective when they are inspired by concrete societal goals and objectives rather than when they are driven by a subjective sense of universal morality and goodness toward mankind. Too often, we have witnessed senseless wars and targeted killings in the name of subjective greater goods and selfish interests. […] Nevertheless, the world is interconnected and public administrators have to deal with internal as well as external issues outside of their national borders. International laws and regulations require that countries’ citizens behave in a certain manner toward fellow neighbors that certain principles of coexistence such as respect for diversity and basic understanding of human rights and dignity are undeniable. Public administrators in a globalized world have to focus on these ideas and create structures that essentially characterize these viewpoints.

The exciting technologies revolutionizing firefighting in 2022 One of the most important tools for a (cid:58)re(cid:58)ghter in the (cid:58)eld is the ability to communicate with other members of the crew, o(cid:88)cers, and decision-makers. Communication can be the di(cid:41)erence between being able to ask for – and receive – help, or being alone as fires move, shift, and change. Communication can be the di(cid:41)erence between having the latest intelligence and knowledge about what is going on, or being in the dark. Communication is also the di(cid:41)erence between having a coordinated, collaborative e(cid:41)ort, or having a number of individuals operating independently – which is the least e(cid:41)ective way to fight a fire. While cellular networks have expanded and improved tremendously – especially in the age of 5G – there are still areas of our country where cellular connectivity and other terrestrial mobile networks aren’t available. There are also some situations where the communications equipment that power terrestrial networks can be damaged in fires, and leave firefighters without connectivity. This is why mobile mesh networking will be a widely adopted technology for (cid:58)re(cid:58)ghters and hotshot crews in 2022. Mobile mesh networking can enable the use of communications and situational awareness tools – such as ATAK – o(cid:41) the grid in places where other terrestrial networks don’t exist. This means that (cid:58)re(cid:58)ghters will be able to share information and see each other’s locations even in isolated, remote locations. They can also be used to spread connectivity over a wide geographic area and to each individual without a single, centralized piece of equipment that can be compromised and fail. This means they can deliver resilient and redundant communications that is always available to the firefighter. Finally, mobile mesh networking can be a low-cost alternative to connecting IoT devices. Instead of each individual sensor requiring its own expensive cellular connection – or incredibly pricey satellite connection – mobile mesh can be used to connect IoT devices over a wide geographic area with no recurring cost. This can help accelerate (cid:58)re-focused IoT programs, and enable the government to extend them to more areas at a lower cost to the taxpayer. Enabling resilient, reliable communications and situational awareness alone is enough to make mobile mesh networking a game-changer for (cid:58)re(cid:58)ghting.

This modern perspective harks back to two moral philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment — David Hume and Adam Smith — who noted that sentiments are integral to people’s views on right and wrong. But most later philosophers in the Western tradition sought to base morality on reason alone. Moral psychologists have recently shown that many people draw on moral perspectives that go well beyond the golden rule.

Why does it matter? Audit quality. First and foremost, how your auditor applies professional skepticism to your audit directly impacts the quality of their service.

Applying skepticism internally By its de(cid:58)nition, professional skepticism is a concept that speci(cid:58)cally applies to auditors, and is not on point when it comes to other audit stakeholders. This is because the de(cid:58)nition implies that the individual applying professional skepticism is independent from the information he or she is analyzing. Other audit stakeholders, such as members of management or the board of directors, are naturally advocates for the organizations they manage and direct and therefore can’t be considered independent, whereas an auditor is required to remain independent. However, rather than audit stakeholders applying professional skepticism as such, these other stakeholders should apply an impartial and diligent mindset to their work and the information they review. This allows the audit stakeholder to remain an advocate for his or her organization, while applying critical skills similar to those applied in the exercise of professional skepticism. This nuanced distinction is necessary to maintain the limited scope to which the definition of professional skepticism applies: the auditor. It is also important to be critical of your own work, and never become complacent. This may be the most di(cid:88)cult type of skepticism to apply, as most of us do not like to have our work criticized. However, critically reviewing one’s own work, essentially as an informal (cid:58)rst level of review, will allow you to take a step back and consider it from a di(cid:41)erent vantage point, which may in turn help detect errors otherwise left unnoticed.

    "enunciado": "Professional skepticism and why it matters to audit stakeholders In auditing, the concept of professional skepticism is ubiquitous. Just as a Jedi in Star Wars is constantly trying to hone his understanding of the “force”, an auditor is constantly crafting his or her ability to apply professional skepticism. It is professional skepticism that provides the foundation for decision-making when conducting an attestation engagement.",

        "texto": "brief definition The professional standards de(cid:58)ne professional skepticism as “an attitude that includes a questioning mind, being alert to conditions that may indicate possible misstatement due to fraud or error, and a critical assessment of audit evidence.” Given this de(cid:58)nition, one quickly realizes that professional skepticism can’t be easily measured. Nor is it something that is cultivated overnight. It is a skill developed over time and a skill that auditors should constantly build and refine. Recently, the extent to which professional skepticism is being employed has gained a lot of criticism. Speci(cid:58)cally, regulatory bodies argue that auditors are not skeptical enough in carrying out their duties. However, as noted in the white paper titled Scepticism: The Practitioners’ Take, published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, simply asking for more skepticism is not a practical solution to this issue, nor is it necessarily always desirable. There is an inevitable tug of war between professional skepticism and audit e(cid:88)ciency. The more skeptical the auditor, typically, the more time it takes to complete the audit. Why does it matter? Audit quality. First and foremost, how your auditor applies professional skepticism to your audit directly impacts the quality of their service. Applying an appropriate level of professional skepticism enhances the likelihood the auditor will understand your industry, lines of business, business processes, and any nuances that make your company different from others, as it naturally causes the auditor to ask questions that may otherwise go unasked. Applying skepticism internally By its de(cid:58)nition, professional skepticism is a concept that speci(cid:58)cally applies to auditors, and is not on point when it comes to other audit stakeholders. This is because the de(cid:58)nition implies that the individual applying professional skepticism is independent from the information he or she is analyzing. Other audit stakeholders, such as members of management or the board of directors, are naturally advocates for the organizations they manage and direct and therefore can’t be considered independent, whereas an auditor is required to remain independent. However, rather than audit stakeholders applying professional skepticism as such, these other stakeholders should apply an impartial and diligent mindset to their work and the information they review. This allows the audit stakeholder to remain an advocate for his or her organization, while applying critical skills similar to those applied in the exercise of professional skepticism. This nuanced distinction is necessary to maintain the limited scope to which the definition of professional skepticism applies: the auditor. It is also important to be critical of your own work, and never become complacent. This may be the most di(cid:88)cult type of skepticism to apply, as most of us do not like to have our work criticized. However, critically reviewing one’s own work, essentially as an informal (cid:58)rst level of review, will allow you to take a step back and consider it from a di(cid:41)erent vantage point, which may in turn help detect errors otherwise left unnoticed. Essentially, you should both consider evidence that supports the initial conclusion and evidence that may be contradictory to that conclusion. The discussion in auditing circles about professional skepticism and how to appropriately apply it continues. It is a challenging notion that’s difficult to adequately articulate.

COVID-19 has accelerated audit (cid:58)rms’ transition toward new ways of operating that will outlast the immediate effects of the pandemic. The sudden shift to remote and (cid:89)exible working by both audit (cid:58)rms and the companies they audit adds a new dimension to the challenge already faced in adapting the audit to a fast-evolving corporate world. Companies’ business models are growing more complex as they move through digital transformation, and this is placing new demands on audit professionals. However, new ways of working will bring important bene(cid:58)ts as well as posing challenges that have to be addressed. As digital technologies and data analysis become increasingly central to the audit process – as well as to companies’ business models – audit (cid:58)rms will require a more diverse range of skills. They have traditionally recruited people with business backgrounds but, in the future, all auditors will need an increased level of technological understanding. In addition, audit (cid:58)rms will require more people with signi(cid:58)cant expertise in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to enable them to leverage technology e(cid:41)ectively for audit purposes.
